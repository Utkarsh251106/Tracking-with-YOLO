Overview:

This project leverages YOLOv8, along with DeepSort for multi-object tracking to identify and track children and adults within video footage. It utilizes OpenCV (cv2) for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, and Jupyter Notebook for development and experimentation. Roboflow is employed for data annotation and management.
